  <h1>Excuse Genie™</h1>

  <br>
<h2>1. Executive Summary (Overview)</h2> 
  <hr>
What is the application? <b>Excuse Genie</b>
Who is the target audience? <b>People aged 16-50 or college aged students to tired parents</b>
<br>
What key problem does it solve? <b>The fear of social conflict when wanting to reject a unwanted event</b>
<br>
What are its unique features or benefits? <b>Themed excuses per event, AI feature so that any event may have an excuse, an excuse rater/comment system</b>
<br>
The application we have created is called Excuse Genie. It is an app that provides multiple themed excuses when the user requires one to get out of an untimely or unwanted event. If by some chance this particular  event is not already in our preset list of excuses we offer a generative AI option for the user to request an excuse for xyz event and for AI to provide a suitable excuse. The target audience for this app is school aged students particularly high school and college students and tired parents. Outside of academics our audience is still <b>college aged students and tired parents (16-50)</b> as this tends to be the time where individuals may be invited to a surplus of events or be required to attend for their child, when they have little to no interest in partaking in. This solves the problem of avoiding social conflict of having to bluntly state that a person has no interest in an invite they are given, it also avoids any potential guilt trip the event hoster may offer. Many individuals in current society have an issue with social confrontation and our app directly offers an out for those types of people. However to limit overreliance and to encourage not using excuses everytime our app has a limited monthly counter of excuses the user may request. This feature is to encourage our users to partake in some events they are invited to. Our other unique features as previously stated are our themed excuses, the use of generative AI, and the ability to rate or comment on excuses  to provide a usable ready solution for whatever event our users may face.

<h2>2. Market Research and Need Analysis</h2>
  <hr>
In order for our product to be the most successful, I will need to research and analyze any competing products. This will allow us to either come up with new ideas based on existing products, or find new ways to think outside of the box to get a competitive edge on existing products. Some competing products are <i>Excuse Generator</i> by Soft Universe Technologies, <i>Excuses.ai</i>, and <i>RandEx excuse generator</i> by Rapheal Lanoutte. All of these apps use some sort of AI to generate common and not so common excuses for all types of problems. In these apps there is always an option for who the message is for and the reason for the excuse. Some of these programs like <i>Excuses.ai</i> adds a twist by adding a feature that allows you pick how risky of an excuse you want. Talking these features into account, our app will add some sort of combination of all of these features and maybe more. Our app will definitely have the ability to <b>decide what excuse you want for a desired event</b>, the <b>severity of the excuse</b>, <b>who the excuse is for</b> specifically, <b>calendar integration</b> to plan out/suggest potential excuses, etc.

<br>
From what I have noticed from these apps is that they all lack several things that could bolster their app. The main thing that deters me from using the other apps is the unappealing UI and generic responses. This is why we will add it to ours to give us a competitive advantage against these other apps.  One thing these apps lack that we hope to incorporate is a seamless integration between emails and messages in order to provide quick and easy access to excuses in case of an emergency or rush. Another idea we plan to integrate that these other apps lack is an <b>“excuse builder”</b> and <b>“excuse history.”</b> The excuse builder takes previously made excuses, remembers them, and allows the app to make stronger better excuses based on your most used excuses. The excuse history allows you to see your previously used excuses to also allow quick and efficient use and to avoid using the same excuse multiple times. I also believe that developing a simple and visually appealing UI will also provide a better user experience and a competitive edge. 
<br>
We may not necessarily have a need for this app but the use of AI is growing in the academic and work fields daily. The graph above shows the use of AI in the academic sense and how it has become a part of students' daily life. With the rapid use of AI our app will prove to be popular and useful. The randEx excuse generator only had 100+ downloads making it not very popular. However there is no advertisement for this app and the app lacks several features. Hopefully with our apps many features and advertising our product will surpass competitors. What makes our app better than just using ChatGPT is how the AI in our product <b>learns and adapts</b> to your schedule giving you way better responses that are less generic and more effective. Also our app hopes to incorporate seamless integration into widgets on your phone giving you excuses without having to open the app. 
<br>
<h2>3. Product Description</h2>
  <hr>
The application is simple in concept, but in order to succeed it needs to be catered to its user’s interests. When users first start up the app, it will ask them to introduce themselves and to share some details about themselves, mainly in regards to their school life or personal interests. The answers will help the application understand the kind of person the user is, with special emphasis how they feel in relation to certain social interactions. Once all of the answers have been submitted, the application will introduce its core features, with the first of these shown being a collage of categories for themes that are typical scenarios to come up with an excuse for not doing them. All the user has to do is select one of these categories in order to proceed with coming up with a believable excuse. 
<br>
The app’s user interface will be designed to cater to people ages <b>16-50</b>, and how it works will be appropriately determined by how the user responds to the prompts. The interface and experience should be comfortable with the user so that they can more likely use the app in the future. With enough detail that the user inputs to the app, it will be able to set up unique and helpful tools for them to play with. For example, if the user says that they’re often requested to go to club meetings or hang-outs that they’re either not in the mood for or don’t feel comfortable going to, the interface will offer scenarios that would perfectly prevent a person from actually going  to a meeting of any kind. These can be as simple as more homework or a quiz to do, or more complex such as a family trip. On a smaller note, the app will have little features to make it more appealing to both the eyes and ears of its users, with different colored backgrounds and some nice music (non-copyrighted of course).
<br>
What will set this application apart from similar excuse generators is that it will have features to make the excuses more convincing. Different tools will be implemented to simulate the excuses themselves in order to perfectly convince others that your excuse is valid. For example, one key feature will involve simulating a phone call so that you can “talk” to someone involved in your excuse. All the user has to do is press the button for simulating a phone call and a voice will appear on the other end after the app “rings” for a few seconds. Its responses will be based on whatever you say during the call. Some features will also <b>include sounds that will fit in with whatever your excuse might be</b>, depending on what it is of course. If, for example, your excuse is that you’re watching a major sports game at the moment, the app can simulate audio of a sports game with commentator banter. Voice actors will also be hired to provide their voice for any audio requested. These features will help the app stand out more and be more well-known and useful.

<h2>4. Possible Problems and Counterarguments</h2>
  <hr>
One important obstacle our app may face is the competition of other existing apps that are functionally similar. Apps such as RandEx, Excuse Generator: Fake Reasons, and Excuse.AI as mentioned earlier are just a few examples. However,<b>we plan to surpass these other apps</b> by integrating features that they do not have such as an integrated calendar with notifications for upcoming events, emailed excuses, and an excuse history that includes who the excuse was for. 
<br>
The most daunting shortcoming of our app is the social impact it may have. We as the developers are aware that nowadays people tend to struggle with social confrontations. The goal of our app aims to ease the stress of those confrontations, not allow people to avoid these confrontations altogether. <b>We support healthy conversations</b> and <b>encourage the attending of the events you are invited to</b>. However we at Excuse Genie are aware that not every event can be made, which is where our product fills in. We can diminish the possibility of overuse of our app by adding a monthly excuse limit.
<br>
Why is our app worth it when generative AI like Chat GPT or Bing AI could provide an excuse already? Our product is <b>easily accessible</b> on the user’s phone in an app form. Not only that, but our app includes <b>privacy approved from the user</b> and has the ability to <b>suggest excuses for events in the calendar</b> linked to our app, <b>something that Chat GPT can not do</b>. We will also aim to make our app more accessible than these online AI platforms which most likely will not remain entirely free in the near future. 
<br>
Throughout the production of Excuse Genie, noticing the flaws, addressing them, and inevitably fixing them will be a continuous process that we anticipate will aid us in delivering a final product that leaves users satisfied. We will have an <b>open feedback section</b> for users to report issues for further improvement as well.
<br>
<h2>5. Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
  <hr>
In today's society, it is common for people to feel overwhelmed. Excuse Genie strives to ease users’ stress and make their lives just a little bit easier when it comes to tense family dinners or convincing your professor to give you an extension when you missed the deadline by only a few hours. 
<br>
Our app includes unique features that sets us apart from our competitors and we will continue to think of new ideas to keep our app fresh, ahead of the competition, and useful for our users. Equipped with generative AI, an integrated calendar, an excuse history, and much more, our app is ready to tackle  any situation the user may find themselves in. Not only does our app include unique features, but it is highly accessible as well. Unlike online generative AI that may soon be locked behind paywalls, our app aims to stay available for everyone to use.
From exhausted students to overwhelmed parents, <b>Excuse Genie is applicable to most anyone in need of some downtime and includes an innovative and user-friendly interface fit for all ages. We plan to move forward with the development of this app in response to the extensive research and preparation that went into its creation thus far</b>.

<h3>Note: </h3>
> This template structure  was prepared using suggestions generated by Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. The prompt used for each was “You are a professor teaching freshman students in an interactive games and media program. Your students' first assignment is to work in groups to research and write a proposal for an application. The proposal must make a case for the product, including evidence to support the need for it. It should anticipate counterarguments, as well. Please provide a template for the proposal that can easily be broken into five discrete components for different students to work on.” The ChatGPT response was used as the starting point, but was significantly revised based on ideas from the other LLM tools, as well as the specifics of the intended project outcomes.
